# 🎮 From Zero to Deployed: Building an AI-Powered Dungeon Game with AWS & Nx

I completed the AWS Nx Plugin tutorial and built an AI-powered dungeon game.

If you're interesting in seeing MCP server and agents in action I highly recommend going through it yourself.

## ⚡ Highlights

- 🤖 **AI Agents** generate dynamic stories using Strands on AWS Bedrock
- 🔗 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables AI to interact with game inventory (database) naturally
- ⚡ **tRPC Type Safety** - Frontend gets instant autocomplete and type-checking for all API calls, no code generation needed
- 🚀 **Auto-mapped Lambda Functions** - Each tRPC route automatically becomes an AWS Lambda function via CDK constructs
- 🚀 **Deployed & Live**: https://d5v0i8bfb0kz7.cloudfront.net/
- 💻 **Full Source**: https://github.com/Gchahm/aws-dnd
- 📚 **Tutorial**: Learn to build it yourself in the AWS [Nx Plugin guide](https://awslabs.github.io/nx-plugin-for-aws/en/get_started/tutorials/dungeon-game/overview/)

## 🏗️ The Stack
